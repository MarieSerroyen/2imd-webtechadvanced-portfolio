## ES2017 .padEnd() & .padStart():

These methodes pad a string to a certain length with another string. 

*.padEnd()* <br/>
You can use this feature if you need to put a string in a certain length field. If you have a name field that is 10 characters long but your name is Marie, you still need to fill 5 characters. With the following code you will add 5 spaces behind your name. 
    Example:
    let name = 'Marie'.padEnd(10);
    console.log(name);  
    Result  “Marie     “
If your name is 4 characters long this methode wil add 6 spaces behind your name.
